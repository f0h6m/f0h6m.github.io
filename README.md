# f0h6m.github.io

This is the source code for my personal website, built using React and Vite.

## Features

- Fast Refresh using [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
- ESLint rules for React and TypeScript
- TypeScript support with type-aware lint rules enabled

## Getting started

To get started with the development of this website, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory.

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running `npm run dev`. This will start the Vite development server, which will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the source code.

## Building the website

To build the website, run `npm run build`. This will create a production-ready build of the website in the `dist` directory.

## Deploying the website

To deploy the website, you can use the GitHub Pages workflow provided in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. This workflow will automatically build and deploy the website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
